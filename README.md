# Linux-Device-Driver

In Edge Cloud Lab, we made presentation and materials for future under-graduate students.

We aimed to learn about how to kernel operates the linux file system.

As follows, these all things are the modules for practicing to test.

- Environment Setting
  - Linux 6.1.2
  - Ubuntu 22.04

- hello
  - 'hello, world!' module
  - Test to know how to insert module in kernel
  - 'hellop' module is the source code using parameter as like ' **insmod hellop.ko PARAMETER** '
  
- scull
  - 'scull' module
  - Test to know how to transfer object as like a plain text between user space and kernel space

- sbull
  - 'sbull' module
  - Test to know how to transfer object as like a block space between user space and kernel space
  - Use **Linux 2.6** and use **the example codes in LDD3** (this code could not operates VFS in Linux 6.1.2)
